# Write the first trading bot
In this guide, i will show you how to easily to create your own trading bot.

## Step 1 : Find the trading idea

Hereâ€™s a simple algorithmic trading strategy for BTC/USDT using a Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) strategy with a Relative Strength Index (RSI) filter. The idea is to use the MACD indicator to identify buy/sell signals and use the RSI as a confirmation filter to reduce false signals.

```
# Buy if MACD crosses above the signal line and RSI is below 70
if macd_line > signal_line and previous_macd_line <= previous_signal_line:
    if rsi < 70:
        return True
return False
```

```
# Sell if MACD crosses below the signal line and RSI is above 30
if macd_line < signal_line and previous_macd_line >= previous_signal_line:
    if rsi > 30:
        return True
return False
```
